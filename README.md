Group 4 topic: Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Approaches for Cardiovascular Risk Prediction

Member: Peifan Bai, Kaite Li, Weijia Lin, Yanwen Wang

Abstract:
Cardiovascular disease is one of the top causes of death globally, making early detection and risk assess- ment critical for saving lives. Traditional risk assessment methods have limitations, and researchers have shown that machine learning can improve prediction accuracy. 
However, most studies focus on individual algorithms rather than comprehensive comparisons. Our study addresses this gap by systematically comparing multiple machine learning approaches for cardiovascular diseaseprediction. We evaluate how different models perform on both classification tasks (predicting whether someone will develop heart disease) and regression tasks (estimating continuous risk scores). Our goal is to identify which methods work best in practice and provide insights that could help doctors make better treatment decisions.
